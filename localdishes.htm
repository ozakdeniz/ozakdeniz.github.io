<h2  style="color:#CED8E8; font-size:50px;text-align:center;">Simit</h2>
<br><br>
<div align="center"><img src="image1.jpg" width="500" height="400" >
<br>
<p style="text-align:center; color: #443587; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;  font-family: calibri">Wander the streets of the city early enough and you’ll see stocks of freshly baked simit being transported across the city (often piled high on trays perched on heads – is there an easier way to move a load of bread?) from bakeries and into mobile carts where they are sold on almost every street corner.Archival sources show the production of this bread in Istanbul dates back to 1593. Utterly ubiquitous across the city, you will be unable to avoid them. A perfect and very cheap snack to fill the voids between the exceptional eats that will punctuate your visit and a wonderful example of the staple that Turkey does exceptionally well – bread. If you can, eat from a freshly baked batch for unrivalled flavour.</p>
<br> <br>
<h2  style="color:#CED8E8; font-size:50px;text-align:center;">Wet Burger</h2>
<br>
<div align="center"><img src="image2.jpg" width="500" height="400" >
<br>
<p style="text-align:center; color: #443587; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;  font-family: calibri">A beloved Istanbul street food, the ıslak hamburger—a.k.a. the wet burger—is not, as we’d hoped, the Turkish equivalent of a French dip sandwich. But it’s a no less addictive, slider-size burger composed of a meat patty (usually beef) on a soft white bun that’s doused with a garlicky, vaguely Italian tomato-based sauce…and then left to sweat among its burger brethren inside a steam box until served to a customer. Don’t worry, these burgers are so popular they’re never left in that box for too long—particularly in the wee hours of the night. </p>

<h2  style="color:#CED8E8; font-size:50px;text-align:center;">Midye Dolma</h2>
<br>
<div align="center"><img src="image3.jpg" width="500" height="400" >
<br>
<p style="text-align:center; color: #443587; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;  font-family: calibri"> These mussels, midye dolma (“mid-yea dol-ma”) are stuffed with seasoned rice (often containing garlic, cinnamon, pepper, currants) and served in their shells with a lemon wedge. They’re a true street food in Istanbul, peddled from little stands—usually lined up like shiny black-and-yellow beacons on well-traveled sokaks—by industrious young men. Despite the bivalves’ famously inexact origins, they are very popular among Istanbulites, especially after-hours, when the savory, bite-size snacks especially hit the spot (just try to stop at three or four). If you have (quite valid) reservations about consuming shellfish on the street, there are plenty of other good, reputable places at which to indulge—and indulge you must, for these are ridiculously delicious.</p>

<br> <br>
<h2  style="color:#CED8E8; font-size:50px;text-align:center;">Fish Sandwich</h2>
<br>
<div align="center"><img src="image5.jpg" width="500" height="400" >
<br>
<p style="text-align:center; color: #443587; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;  font-family: calibri">One of Istanbul’s most quintessential meals is as simple as can be: balık ekmek (“fish bread”), a fish sandwich most famously consumed under or around the Galata bridge, where it’s been peddled for decades. The fish in question is most often uskumru, or mackerel, grilled, seasoned, and served with lettuce, onion, and (occasionally) a grilled hot pepper or two on a crusty roll with a squeeze of lemon. It’s a fitting repast for Istanbul, situated as it is between the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara, within striking distance of the Mediterranean; sadly, however, decades of overfishing have prompted most vendors here to source mackerel from Norway rather than local waters. Despite this globalization of the trade—and the touristy nature of the experience, and the fact that the various vendors can be hit-or-miss—the balık ekmek remains an Istanbul essential.</p>

<h2  style="color:#CED8E8; font-size:50px;text-align:center;">Gozleme</h2>
<br>
<div align="center"><img src="image6.jpg" width="500" height="400" >
<br>
<p style="text-align:center; color: #443587; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;  font-family: calibri">It is made with a hand-rolled pastry called Yufka -Turkish flat bread that is made thin round unleavened flat bread similar to lavash. Yufka is folded over various ingredients such as spinach & feta cheese, spinach-feta-minced meat, spinach-feta-egg, seafood, egg, minced meat, patatoes, mushrooms, etc., then baked on a griddle.</p>
